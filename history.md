# History of the Howto Guides

On the 27th of January 2007 I launched a [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) website called the **Debian Wiki**. I began this website solely for selfish reasons as I wanted to document how I got various software packages up and running so I could come back to them at a later stage for easy deployment.

I had no choice really but to do this because everything I found online had become outdated and I had to solve my challenges by myself. What I didn't realise was how popular this wiki would become and people were using these howto's on a daily basis.

## What was all the fuss about?

The original homepage back in 2007 had this to say about what the Debian Wiki was all about.

> This wiki is dedicated to various HOWTOs on setting up a Debian GNU/Linux system. There is a ton of documentation out there covering almost every aspect of using Debian however I found that most only relate to the older Debian Distros. I am always looking for the best out-of-box solution for the newer Debian distros namely Debian Etch (version 4) and Debian Sid (unstable version) which is what speared me on to start this wiki.

> Most of the content found in this wiki was adapted from documentation I found for the older distros, i.e. Debian Sarge (version 3.1), which I have used as a reference point and adapted to work with either Etch or Sid. I've noticed that using HOWTO's from Debian Sarge require some tweaking to work with Etch and Sid and as I figure these out I'll post on the wiki accordingly. I am also very active on the Debian and Ubuntu mailing lists and forums and a lot of the solutions to problems I encounter come directly from using them.

> The General Disclaimer contains important information about what will/won't work on your Linux distro.

## Why Debian?

I've thought long and hard about why I chose Debian as my flavour and I think it all boiled down to one key bit of functionality; the APT package manager. Through APT I found Debian to be superior to anything else competing with them. There was that but the other reason was I really digged the logo!
